# Fusion Search Zone Tracking

## detect

Using YOLOv8-ros to detect target in Gazebo  simulation environment.

```bash
cd your_workspace
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch yolov8_ros v8.launch
```

## track

Utilizing the Kalman filter to predict the target's position in the world frame, and project the prediction onto the image frame to generate a new search area. This new search area is then fused with the native search area of CSRT.

```bash
roslaunch projection fst.launch
rosbag play your_ros_bag
```

The purple point in Rviz represents the Kalman Filter's prediction in the world frame, while the green bounding box in the OpenCV window indicates the tracking results of CSRT.
